# SMS-Appointment-Notification-v2
The version 2 of the sms software

The very basic process that this code has been built follows as such:
1. Build the Flask endpoint in the Controllers
2. Create the model from the data sent by the endpoint
3. Create the transformer used to modify/transform the data in the model, where applicable
4. Create the service that will perform all the logic/functions on the model
